This file is for a single turbine in the boundary layer.

k-Epsilon Turbulence Model modified with injection of k and epsilon at actuator disk to match recovery of a real wind turbine.

An Actuator Disks representing a wind turbine in a boundary layer flow. A 6.75m long domain in the wind tunnel. Turbine coordinate (35 0.5 0.1875)
