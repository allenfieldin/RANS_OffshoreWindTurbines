This file is for an array in the boundary layer. It contains a 3 by 1 array of wind turbines.

k-Epsilon Turbulence Model modified with injection of k and epsilon at actuator disk to match recovery of a real wind turbine.

Three Actuator Disks representing wind turbines in a Boundary Layer Flow. A 6.75m long domain in the wind tunnel. Turbine coordinates (35 0.5 0.1875), (37 0.5 0.1875), (39 0.5 0.1875)
